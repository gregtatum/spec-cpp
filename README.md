# C++ Learning Spec

This is a test suite that encapsulates my C++ learning in a series of tests. The building process is done through a `makefile` so from the command line run `make` to build it, and then `./main` to run it. Or do both steps at the same time with `make test`. Individual tests can be run by setting the `TEST` environment variable.

```
make test TEST=features::pointers
```

## Requirements

The build process assumes that `clang++` is on the path with the ability to use the std library `c++1y`.

ICU4C was added as a library, and it must be added to `/usr/local`. This directory is specified in `makefile-icu.mk`. To install the ICU library on macOS:

```
git clone git@github.com:unicode-org/icu.git
cd icu/icu4c/source
./runConfigureICU MacOSX
```

## Test output

```

    âœ” It can default initialize.
    âœ” It creates a string

features::arrays

  arrays can be created on the stack.
    âœ” An array was created, but it's still uninitialized. Acces
    âœ” The value can be accessed, but its value could be anything. UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 2 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 3 can be accessed
    âœ” The compiler doesn't care if we unintentionally read values outside of the array. UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
  arrays can be initialized in one line
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 2 can be accessed
  arrays can be created through 'universal initialization'
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 2 can be accessed
  Arrays don't need to have every entry initialized
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 is not initialized
  Static arrays are always initialized to 0.
    âœ” The value is 0
    âœ” The value is 0
    âœ” The value is 0
  Heap allocated arrays
    âœ” Created 11 on the heap
    âœ” Created 22 on the heap
    âœ” Created 33 on the heap
  Arrays can be passed to functions
    âœ” One was added to array
    âœ” One was added to array
    âœ” One was added to array
  Arrays can be treated like pointers, and the memory address is copied to the calling function
    âœ” One was added to the first element
    âœ” The rest of the array is not modified
    âœ” The rest of the array is not modified
  Pointer arithmetic works on arrays coerced to pointers
    âœ” Can read the first element as a pointer
    âœ” Can read the second element using pointer arithmetic
    âœ” Can read the second element using pointer arithmetic
  You can pass by references, but only at a fixed array size
    âœ” First element not modified
    âœ” Second element was modified because the function call returned an lvalue reference
    âœ” The third element was not modified
  Passing arrays is mainly type checking by the compiler, but then it copies the memory address of the array to the callee's arguments.
    âœ” The memory values are the same.
  array sizeof() and passing arrays to functions
    âœ” The size of the first member is that of an int
    âœ” The same is true when looking at as a pointer
    âœ” The size of the array element is only accessible on the current stack
    âœ” Variable lengths can be created, but they are only stored on the current stack
    âœ” When passing to a function, the stack-allocated array degrades to a pointer.
    âœ” This also happens even when the size of the array in the arguments is explicit, like array[6]
    âœ” Size arguments are a lie

  the value on the stack is the memory address of the heap
    âœ” The value itself is a memory address, so it shouldn't equal our value.
    âœ” The memory address is still in lexical scope and can be re-assigned, but it points at possibly anything in memory. Accesing it is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR!
  multiple pointers point to the same place in memory
    âœ” The values are in the heap are the same
    âœ” The value on the stack is initially the same as what's on the heap
    âœ” The value on the heap was updated
