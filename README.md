# C++ Learning Spec

This is a test suite that encapsulates my C++ learning in a series of tests. The building process is done through a `makefile` so from the command line run `make` to build it, and then `./main` to run it. Or do both steps at the same time with `make test`. Individual tests can be run by setting the `TEST` environment variable.

```
make test TEST=features::pointers
```

## Requirements

The build process assumes that `clang++` is on the path with the ability to use the std library `c++1y`.

## Test output
```

src::test

  Assertions
    âœ” Does not throw
    âœ” Equality does work

features::pointers

  stack values
    âœ” Declaring a simple value puts it on the stack.
  puts a value on the heap
    âœ” ðŸš§  The value is not initialized, so it could be anything. (possibly intermittent)
    âœ” Values placed on the heap can be accessed through the * operator.
  the value on the stack is the memory address of the heap
    âœ” The value itself is a memory address, so it shouldn't equal our value.
    âœ” The memory address is still in lexical scope and can be re-assigned, but it points at possibly anything in memory. Accesing it is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR!
  multiple pointers point to the same place in memory
    âœ” The values are in the heap are the same
    âœ” The value on the stack is initially the same as what's on the heap
    âœ” The value on the heap was updated
    âœ” The other pointer points to the same value
    âœ” The value on the stack is a separate value, and is not updated
  references
    âœ” The value is on the stack
    âœ” The reference points to the value on the stack.
    âœ” The value on the stack was updated
    âœ” This is reflected in our own pointer.
  passing around pointers
    âœ” Starts as 32
    âœ” Is mutated and added by one
    âœ” The new value is 34
    âœ” But the original can't be changed

features::lvalueReference

  lvalue references
    âœ” The int value is 32
    âœ” The ref value is the same
    âœ” The int value has changed
    âœ” So has the ref value
    âœ” The ref value is changed
    âœ” The original value has changed as well
  const lvalue references
    âœ” The int value is 32
    âœ” The ref value is the same
    âœ” The int value has changed
    âœ” The ref value will change even thought it's const
  passing lvalue references to functions
    âœ” Starts as 32
    âœ” Is mutated and added by one
    âœ” The new value is 34
    âœ” But the original can't be changed
  lvalue references can be returned from another function
    âœ” Got the second entry
    âœ” The array value can be updated
    âœ” The array value can be updated
  lvalue references can be assigned to, as they are lvalues
    âœ” The array value is updated too
  lvalue references can be stored in structs
    âœ” The ref struct holds the value 32
    âœ” The struct holds the value 32
    âœ” The ref struct's value can be changed.
    âœ” The non-ref struct's value remains the same.
    âœ” The original value changes too
  lvalue references in structs can't break out to outer lexical scopes
    âœ” The ref struct can be initialized with a value.
    âœ” The struct  can be initialized with a value.
    âœ” Setting the intHolder in a different lexical scope is fine, as the value is copied.
    âœ” We can't assign a reference to a value in a exterior lexical scope block

features::rvalueReference

  rvalue references
    âœ” rvalue references point to temporary values
  rvalue references can be passed to functions
    âœ” The rvalue reference function added one.

rusty::option

  Option
    âœ” Can unwrap a value
    âœ” A some value is Some
    âœ” A some value is not None
    âœ” Cannot unwrap a None
    âœ” A none value is not Some
    âœ” A none value is None

rusty::vec

  Vec
    âœ” The vector starts with 0 capacity
    âœ” The initial length is also 0.
  Vec::push
    âœ” The capacity is now 1
    âœ” The length is also 1
    âœ” The value added is 1
    âœ” The second value is none
    âœ” The capacity is doubled after a push
    âœ” The length is also doubled after a push
    âœ” The value was added
    âœ” The value was added
    âœ” The last value is none
    âœ” The capacity is doubled after a push
    âœ” The length is only incremented
    âœ” The value was added
    âœ” The value was added
    âœ” The value was added
    âœ” The last value is none

 All tests passed!
