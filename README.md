# C++ Learning Spec

This is a test suite that encapsulates my C++ learning in a series of tests. The building process is done through a `makefile` so from the command line run `make` to build it, and then `./main` to run it. Or do both steps at the same time with `make test`. Individual tests can be run by setting the `TEST` environment variable.

```
make test TEST=features::pointers
```

## Requirements

The build process assumes that `clang++` is on the path with the ability to use the std library `c++1y`.

## Test output
```

features::arrays

  arrays can be created on the stack.
    âœ” An array was created, but it's still uninitialized. Acces
    âœ” The value can be accessed, but its value could be anything. UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 2 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 3 can be accessed
    âœ” The compiler doesn't care if we unintentionally read values outside of the array. UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
  arrays can be initialized in one line
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 2 can be accessed
  arrays can be created through 'universal initialization'
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 2 can be accessed
  Arrays don't need to have every entry initialized
    âœ” Value at index 0 can be accessed
    âœ” Value at index 1 is not initialized
  Static arrays are always initialized to 0.
    âœ” The value is 0
    âœ” The value is 0
    âœ” The value is 0
  Heap allocated arrays
    âœ” Created 11 on the heap
    âœ” Created 22 on the heap
    âœ” Created 33 on the heap
  Arrays can be passed to functions
    âœ” One was added to array
    âœ” One was added to array
    âœ” One was added to array
  Arrays can be treated like pointers, and the memory address is copied to the calling function
    âœ” One was added to the first element
    âœ” The rest of the array is not modified
    âœ” The rest of the array is not modified
  Pointer arithmetic works on arrays coerced to pointers
    âœ” Can read the first element as a pointer
    âœ” Can read the second element using pointer arithmetic
    âœ” Can read the second element using pointer arithmetic
  You can pass by references, but only at a fixed array size
    âœ” First element not modified
    âœ” Second element was modified because the function call returned an lvalue reference
    âœ” The third element was not modified
  Passing arrays is mainly type checking by the compiler, but then it copies the memory address of the array to the callee's arguments.
    âœ” The memory values are the same.

features::lvalueReference

  lvalue references
    âœ” The int value is 32
    âœ” The ref value is the same
    âœ” The int value has changed
    âœ” So has the ref value
    âœ” The ref value is changed
    âœ” The original value has changed as well
  const lvalue references
    âœ” The int value is 32
    âœ” The ref value is the same
    âœ” The int value has changed
    âœ” The ref value will change even thought it's const
  passing lvalue references to functions
    âœ” Starts as 32
    âœ” Is mutated and added by one
    âœ” The new value is 34
    âœ” But the original can't be changed
  lvalue references can be returned from another function
    âœ” Got the second entry
    âœ” The array value can be updated
    âœ” The array value can be updated
  lvalue references can be assigned to, as they are lvalues
    âœ” The array value is updated too
  lvalue references can be stored in structs
    âœ” The ref struct holds the value 32
    âœ” The struct holds the value 32
    âœ” The ref struct's value can be changed.
    âœ” The non-ref struct's value remains the same.
    âœ” The original value changes too
  lvalue references in structs can't break out to outer lexical scopes
    âœ” The ref struct can be initialized with a value.
    âœ” The struct  can be initialized with a value.
    âœ” Setting the intHolder in a different lexical scope is fine, as the value is copied.
    âœ” We can't assign a reference to a value in a exterior lexical scope block

features::pointers

  stack values
    âœ” Declaring a simple value puts it on the stack.
  puts a value on the heap
    âœ” ðŸš§  The value is not initialized, so it could be anything. (possibly intermittent)
    âœ” Values placed on the heap can be accessed through the * operator.
  the value on the stack is the memory address of the heap
    âœ” The value itself is a memory address, so it shouldn't equal our value.
    âœ” The memory address is still in lexical scope and can be re-assigned, but it points at possibly anything in memory. Accesing it is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR!
  multiple pointers point to the same place in memory
    âœ” The values are in the heap are the same
    âœ” The value on the stack is initially the same as what's on the heap
    âœ” The value on the heap was updated
    âœ” The other pointer points to the same value
    âœ” The value on the stack is a separate value, and is not updated
  references
    âœ” The value is on the stack
    âœ” The reference points to the value on the stack.
    âœ” The value on the stack was updated
    âœ” This is reflected in our own pointer.
  passing around pointers
    âœ” Starts as 32
    âœ” Is mutated and added by one
    âœ” The new value is 34
    âœ” But the original can't be changed

features::rvalueReference

  rvalue references
    âœ” rvalue references point to temporary values
  rvalue references can be passed to functions
    âœ” The rvalue reference function added one.

features::smartPointers

  Create a unique_ptr
    âœ” Can create a smart pointer
    âœ” After leaving it's scope, the reference is removed.
  Delete it before the end of the scope
    âœ” Can create a smart pointer
    âœ” Reseting deletes the object at the reference.
  Release the ownership of the object
    âœ” Can create a smart pointer
    âœ” The object was not removed from the heap
    âœ” The object was manually removed
  Create a shared_ptr
    âœ” A shared pointer is created, and shared with the outer scope
    âœ” The pointer is still shared, so the underlying object still exists.
    âœ” After leaving both scope, the object is destructed
  Create a weak_ptr
    âœ” A shared pointer is created, and shared with the outer scope
    âœ” The weak pointer is not expired
    âœ” The pointer should be deleted, as it was only weakly held
    âœ” The weak pointer is expired
  Create a weak_ptr, but lock it
    âœ” A shared pointer is created, and shared with the outer scope
    âœ” The weak pointer is not expired
    âœ” The pointer is still alive, because the weak ptr locked it
    âœ” The weak pointer is expired
    âœ” The lock and original value are out of scope, the object was deleted
    âœ” The weak pointer is expired

features::threads

    âœ” A none value is None

rusty::vec

  Vec
    âœ” The vector starts with 0 capacity
